# Systematic Curve Overlay Framework
**Strategic Rationale, Architecture, and Risk Governance**

## 1. Executive Summary

**The Objective:**
To transform the desk’s flow hedging operations from a mechanical "Cost Center" into a systematic "Alpha Source." We aim to capture structural inefficiencies in the USD SOFR Swap curve without altering the core risk profile (DV01/Duration) of the book.

**The Solution:**
We have developed a "Decision Support Tool" that acts as a **Smart Router** for risk execution. Rather than mechanically hedging client flow at the exact tenor requested (e.g., executing a 10Y hedge against a 10Y client trade), the system scans the yield curve for statistically "cheap" tenors (e.g., 9.5Y or 10.5Y).

**The Edge:**
The strategy employs a **"Drift-Aware" Mean Reversion** logic. It identifies trades that offer a dual margin of safety:
1.  **Statistical Value:** The point is mathematically "cheap" relative to the curve (Mean Reversion).
2.  **Positive Carry:** The position earns net interest income while we wait for the price to correct (Drift).

## 2. The Problem & The Solution

### The Friction: Why the Opportunity Exists
The USD interest rate market is highly efficient at the macro level but inefficient at the micro level due to segmentation:
* **Client Rigidity:** Corporate treasurers and pension funds demand hedges at specific dates (e.g., "10 Years from today"). They are price-insensitive to adjacent points on the curve.
* **Supply/Demand Knots:** These rigid flows create local supply/demand imbalances. A massive receiver flow at the 10Y point might depress the 10Y rate temporarily, making the 9Y or 11Y look "expensive" (or the 10Y "cheap") by comparison.
* **The Execution Gap:** Human traders process this flow too quickly to analyze the full curve for relative value optimization on every ticket.

### The Overlay Solution: "Smart Routing"
The Framework functions as an intelligent layer between Client Flow and Street Execution.

1.  **Input:** The Desk receives a Client Risk request (e.g., Receive Fixed $100k DV01 in 10Y).
2.  **Scan:** The system analyzes the curve to find the most efficient instrument to hedge this risk.
3.  **Optimization:** It might identify that the 9Y tenor is statistically 2.0 standard deviations "richer" (better price) than the 10Y.
4.  **Output:** The Trader executes the hedge in the 9Y instead of the 10Y.
    * **Result:** The Desk is hedged against interest rate moves (Beta Neutral) but captures the relative value spread (Alpha) as the 9Y and 10Y relationships normalize.

**Operational Note:** This system is a **Trader Tool**. It provides signals; it does not auto-execute. All final trade booking and enterprise risk accounting remain within the firm’s official Risk Management Systems.

## 3. The Statistical Engine (The "Ruler")

To identify "Rich" or "Cheap" points, we must first define "Fair Value." Since raw interest rates are volatile, we cannot use simple price changes. We use a **Frozen Daily Model** to create a stable statistical ruler.

### A. Defining "Fair Value"
We employ a hybrid approach to model the curve:
1.  **Spline Model (Micro):** Think of this as a flexible ruler that bends to fit the curve points. It is excellent at detecting local kinks (e.g., a dislocation between the 7Y and 8Y).
2.  **PCA Model (Macro):** Principal Component Analysis identifies the global factors driving the curve (Level, Slope, Curvature). It tells us where a tenor *should* be based on the broad market movement.
3.  **The "Z-Score":** We combine these models to generate a Z-Score. A Z-Score of **+2.0** means a tenor is 2 standard deviations "Cheap" vs. fair value. A score of **0.0** is Fair Value.

### B. The "Frozen" Convention
To ensure stability for the trader, the statistical parameters are calculated at the **Market Open** and frozen for the day.
* **Why?** If we recalculated the model every second, a "cheap" asset might suddenly look "fair" just because the market moved slightly, creating "flickering" signals.
* **Benefit:** This ensures that intraday price movements are measured against a stationary benchmark.

## 4. The "Drift-Aware" Logic: Valuation Methodology

A pure Mean Reversion strategy (betting on price convergence) is risky—market irrationality can persist longer than solvency. To mitigate this, we have integrated **Drift Awareness**.

### The Two Components of Return
We assess every potential trade on its **Total Return Profile**, not just its price.

1.  **Mean Reversion (The "Snap Back"):**
    * The profit made when the Z-Score returns to 0.
    * *Nature:* High Upside, Uncertain Timing.

2.  **Drift (The "Rent"):**
    * **Carry:** The net coupon income (Fixed Rate received vs. Floating Rate paid).
    * **Rolldown:** The capital gain generated as a bond/swap slides down a steep yield curve over time (e.g., a 7Y swap becoming a 6.9Y swap).
    * *Nature:* Steady Income, Deterministic.

### The Drift Gate & Composite Score
The system enforces a strict discipline regarding Carry:

* **The Drift Gate (The "Do No Harm" Rule):**
    We explicitly reject any trade where the Drift (Carry + Roll) is significantly negative, regardless of how "cheap" the Z-Score looks. We refuse to bleed money while waiting for a reversion.

* **The Composite Score:**
    Trades are ranked by a weighted combination:
    $$Score = Z_{Score} + (Weight \times Drift_{bps})$$
    * *Implication:* We will prefer a trade with a lower Z-Score (less "cheap") if it pays a massive positive Carry. This creates a portfolio that is "Paid to Wait."

## 5. Modeling Assumptions & Accounting

To facilitate rapid decision-making, the model makes specific working simplifications. Note that these affect the *Signal Generation* only; actual PnL is tracked by the official Enterprise Risk System.

1.  **Funding Proxy:**
    * *Assumption:* The system calculates the "Cost of Carry" (Float Leg) using the shortest available tenor in the curve snapshot (e.g., 1M SOFR) as a proxy for the funding rate.
    * *Reality:* Actual funding costs may vary slightly based on OIS spreads or internal transfer pricing. This simplification allows for robust relative comparisons between tenors without integrating complex bank-internal funding grids.

2.  **Linear Risk Decay:**
    * *Assumption:* We model the risk exposure (DV01) of a swap fading linearly over time (Actual/360 basis).
    * *Reality:* This is a standard industry approximation for swaps and aligns sufficiently with official valuation for holding periods of <30 days.

## 6. Risk Management & Governance

The system is architected with a "Safety First" philosophy, employing three distinct layers of defense.

### Layer 1: The Regime Filter (Exogenous)
* **Function:** Monitors the macro environment.
* **Logic:** It tracks the "Trendiness" and "Signal Health" of the curve. If the curve begins trending violently (e.g., a macro breakout or Fed surprise), the assumption of Mean Reversion is violated.
* **Action:** The system flags the regime as "Unsafe" and blocks new entries. The trader is advised to stand down.

### Layer 2: The Shock Filter (Endogenous)
* **Function:** Monitors the strategy's own performance.
* **Logic:** It regresses the Realized PnL against the Model's Predictions. If the strategy begins losing money in a way the model cannot explain (e.g., residuals exceed 1.5 standard deviations), it indicates a "Model Break."
* **Action:** Triggers a **Panic Exit**. The system recommends liquidating positions immediately to preserve capital.

### Layer 3: Fly Gates (Structural)
* **Function:** Prevents entering broken curve structures.
* **Logic:** Before buying a "cheap" 7Y tenor, the system checks the 5s7s10s Butterfly. If the butterfly is statistically broken, the 7Y isn't "cheap"—it's structurally dislocated.
* **Action:** The trade is rejected to avoid "catching a falling knife."

## 7. Robustness & Validation

To prove this strategy relies on structural market inefficiencies rather than historical luck ("Overfitting"), we subjected it to a rigorous **"Tournament" Stress Test**.

### The "Multiverse" Methodology
We did not just test on historical data. We generated **10 Parallel Universes** (Synthetic Data Sets) by:
1.  **Jittering Time:** Randomly shifting historical trade dates by ±5 business days.
2.  **Jittering Size:** Randomly altering trade sizes by ±10%.

### The Tournament Results
The strategy configuration was required to remain profitable across *all* 10 synthetic universes to be considered valid.
* **Finding:** The optimization process revealed a strong preference for **High Drift Weight**.
* **Conclusion:** The most robust version of this strategy is not pure statistical arbitrage; it is a **Systematic Carry Strategy** that uses statistical Z-Scores to time the entry points. This confirms that "Time" and "Carry" are the primary drivers of Alpha, providing a high degree of confidence in the strategy's economic viability.
